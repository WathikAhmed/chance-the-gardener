			<p>This application was developed as part of an undergraduate capstone project by group PS2102 of Western Sydeny University. The capstone project aims to challenge students by requiring us to utilise all our knowledge and skills gained throughout our studies.</p>
			<p>We are honoured to have gotten the chance to work with Jonathon Wolfe to bring his innovative idea to life.</p>
			<h3>Who we are</h3>
			<p>Our team consisted of four members, each studying their own IT-related degrees:
				<ul>
					<li>Jessica Lim</li>
					<li>Wathik Al-Qaysi</li>
					<li>Charlie Chau</li>
					<li>Fan Wang</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Fascinated with the drive and craftsmanship of the people around us, we wanted to incorporate that same level of energy, passion, and detail-oriented work as much as possible into not only this project, but also our own lives.</p>
